# Question:
What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?
The purpose of this linear regression model is to predict the amount of funding a startup will receive based on prior 
successfully funded projects on kickstarter. Through the exploration of this model, those looking to start a company will be able to see what factors could be
associated 

Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?


# Data Description:
The training data will be acquired from Kickstarter's 
What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

# Tools:
How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project? 
I will use Beautiful Soup and Selenium. 
Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

# MVP Goal:
What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
Scraping 1,000 profiles from Kickstarter with 10 features each to incorporate into a linear regression model.
