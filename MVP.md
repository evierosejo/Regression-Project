# MVP: A Linear Regression Model Looking at Start-up Funding

The goal of my model is to better infer what factors are the most important in predicting a start-up's funding amount on Kickstarter.

To explore this, I first began by creating a linear regression model with one feature to investigate the relationship between the number of backers a project has 
and the amount of funding it receives. The figure above shows the diagnostic plots for this model. 

From here, I intend to expand my linear regression model to describe all of the features in my dataset, as well as, validate, test and run an outlier analysis on
the model.
